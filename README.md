This project focuses on integrating a public API using Python and visualizing the retrieved data. Specifically, it uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time 5-day 
weather forecast data for a specified city. The data is then analyzed and visualized using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to display trends such as temperature changes 
over time. The project showcases how to work with APIs, parse JSON data, and create meaningful visualizations from real-world datasets.
